# RedditModerationTopicModel
This github contains all the supplementary materials for the paper article: 

“We don't ban you immediately for an offense”: Reddit moderation and the importance of remedying norm violations for high-quality online dialogue.


## Details

The github contains materials for replicating the findings in the article. 
It is organized around one Python notebook (Supplementary_matrials_A)

There are three folders:

(1) data: Contains all data required for replication

(2) model: Contains the trained topic model

(3) Supplementary materials B: Contains additional documentation pertaining to the paper

We have also zipped both data files for easy download and access in the Python notebook.

## Running the notebook

We recommend using Google Colab for running the notebook. This is because it does not require any local storage of data nor the local installation of software and packages. Instead, the notebook will be run on a virtual environment hosted by Google (deleted after the runtime is closed or ended). 

To open the notebook in Colab you have to:

(1) Open the notebook in GitHub 

(2) Click the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the notebook. 

At this point, you maybe prompted to sign into a Google account. 

(3) Click "File" > "Save copy in drive" 

This will open a new version of the notebook in your browser and save a copy into your Google Drive. 

(4) Close the first notebook link.

(5) Follow notebook instructions to run.

NOTES:

- Steps (3) and (4) are optional - the notebook should run fine without doing this and the original notebook should be unaffected

- The notebook can also be run locally. However, this will require installation of used packages into the local Python environment.
