# Supplementary materials: Norm repair as an extension to the deliberative dialogue model


This GitHub contains all the supplementary materials for the article: 

*Norm repair as an extension to the deliberative dialogue model*

## Details

The github contains materials for replicating the findings in the article and any additional supplementary materials. 
It is organized around one Python notebook (Supplementary_materials_A)

There are three folders:

(1) "data": Contains all data required for replication.

(2) "model": Contains the trained topic model weights and pre-processing details.

(3) "GitHub supplementary materials" with all additional supplementary materials. 

We have also compressed both data files (model_data.zip) for easy download and access in the Python notebook.

## Running the notebook

We recommend using Google Colab for running the notebook. This is because it does not require any local storage of data nor the local installation of software and packages. Instead, the notebook will be run on a virtual environment hosted by Google (deleted after the runtime is closed or ended). 

To open the notebook in Colab you have to:

(1) Open the notebook in GitHub 

(2) Click the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the notebook. 

At this point, you may be prompted to sign into a Google account. 

(3) Click "File" > "Save copy in drive" 

This will open a new version of the notebook in your browser and save a copy into your Google Drive. 

(4) Close the first notebook link.

(5) Follow notebook instructions to run.

NOTES:

- Steps (3) and (4) are optional - the notebook should run fine without doing this and the original notebook should be unaffected

- Although the notebook can also be executed locally, doing so requires the installation of necessary packages into your local Python environment.
